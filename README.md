# better-belly

This is the iOS client for an app that is designed to help users follow a low FODMAP diet - a diet shown to decrease IBS symptoms. The app was built at Hack the North 2018 in a team of four. The backend is currently not available in a public repo.

The app allows a user to take a picture of a food item, and indicates whether or not it falls under the low FODMAP category. 

## Getting Started

* First clone the repo

  ```git clone https://github.com/grazietta/better-belly.git```

* Once cloned open the better-belly folder and double click on the ```.xcworkspace``` folder to open the app in XCode

* Finally build and run the app

* Once the app is up and running the following user interface should be visible on the simulator or iPhone
